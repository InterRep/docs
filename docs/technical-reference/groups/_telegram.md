# Telegram

Telegram is a very popular cross-platform, instant messaging system. Interep allows Telegram users to add a bot to groups and join the corresponding Interep groups with magic links.

2. the group users run a bot command to join the Interep group;
3. the group users click on the magic link sent in the private chat and is redirected to an appropriate Interep endpoint;
4. the users connect their Metamask wallets;
5. the users generates an identity commitment for the Telegram provider;
6. the user joins the Interep group or leaves it if they have previously joined.
